// write a function called returnTrue, that takes in no argument and just returns boolean true:




// write a function called returnsArg that that takes in one argument and returns argument




// write a function, addTwo that takes in one argument, which you can assume to be a number, and adds 2 to it






// write a function, addTwoArgs that takes in two arguments, which you can assume to be numbers, and adds them together






// write a function, subtractTwoArgs that takes in two arguments, which you can assume to be numbers, and subtracts second argument from the first




// write a function, firstBiggerThanSecond, that takes two arguments, which are integers. IF first argument is bigger than second argument then return boolean true. Don't need to write else statement






// write a function isFirstBigger, that takes two arguments, which are integers. IF first argument is bigger than second, THEN returns boolean true, ELSE returns boolean false. You can assume that the two arguments WILL NOT be equal




// write a function bigSmallEqual, that takes two arguments, which are integers. IF first argument is bigger than second, then returns STRING "First argument is bigger than second argument", ELSE IF first argument is equal to second argument, returns STRING "First argument is equal to second argument", ELSE returns STRING "First argument is not bigger than second argument"






// write a function isMultipleOfFour, that takes one argument, which is an integer. IF this argument is a multiple of four, then returns boolean true, ELSE returns boolean false.






// write a function tellMultiple345, that takes one argument, which is an integer. IF that argument is a multiple of 3, then returns a STRING "argument is a multiple of 3", ELSE IF argument is a multiple of 3, then returns "argument is a multiple of 4", ELSE IF argument is a multiple of 5, then returns "argument is a multiple of 5", ELSE returns "not a multiple of 3, 4 or 5". Assume that the test cases will be less than 11.




// write a function simpleFizzBuzz, that takes one argument, which is an integer. If that argument is a multiple of 3, then returns a STRING "fizz". If the argument is a multiple of 5, then returns a STRING "buzz". If the argument is not a multiple of 3 or 5, return "nothing". Assume that the argument won't be a multiple of both 3 and 5.




// write a function nearlyFizzBuzz, that takes one argument, which is an integer. If that argument is a multiple of 3, then returns a STRING "fizz". If the argument is a multiple of 5, then returns a STRING "buzz". If that argument is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (e.g. 15), return "fizzbuzz". If the argument is not a multiple of 3 or 5, return "nothing".
